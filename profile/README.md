CyberLink PhotoDirector Ultra is an all-in-one photo editor for enthusiasts. It blends Adobe Lightroom‚Äôs workflow with Photoshop‚Äôs features and help from Photoshop Elements. It gives Adobe some competition with its Photoshop-like tools. These include change layers, masks, text kerning, and Guided Edits. But its interface isn‚Äôt as polished. I recommend PhotoDirector. It‚Äôs easy to use. But, Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Photoshop Elements are Editors‚Äô Choice winners.
